### Project Description
Welcome to our UNC-BIOS735 project. In this repository, you will find a variety of scripts and folders. Telemarketing is a method of marketing directly to customers via phone or the Internet in order to sell goods or services. Telemarketing has increasingly been used in industrial sales organizations such as banks and insurance companies. Implementing this method successfully is difficult. To improve the performance in telemarketing, predictive analytics could play an essential role in the success of telemarketing operations. A data driven approach could be used in a decision support system to maximize the success rate of sales using key metrics from potential customers. A well-trained predictive model could potentially classify telemarketing targets using demographic information such as education, income, or marriage status. By training models on historical data including demographic information and success labels, a predictive classification model can be constructed using either parametric methods such as logistic regression or non-parametric methods such as random forests (RF) or support vector machines (SVM). In this project, we will evaluate the performance of both parametric and non-parametric statistical learning methods in predicting the success of telemarketing from bank data. Our primary outcome of interest is whether a client would agree to subscribe a term deposit after the targeted telemarketing campaign.


### Dataset
